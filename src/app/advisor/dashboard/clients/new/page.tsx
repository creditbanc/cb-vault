 * - Replaces public client self-signup
 * - Ensures data quality through advisor verification
 * 
 * WORKFLOW:
 * 1. Advisor conducts onboarding call with client
 * 2. Advisor fills in client information via this form
 * 3. Form creates client account and syncs to GHL
 * 4. Client receives login credentials via email
 * 
 * LOCATION: /advisor/clients/new
